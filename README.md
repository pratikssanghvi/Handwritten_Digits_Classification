# Handwritten_Digits_Classification
Implementing a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network on MNIST handwritten digit dataset and evaluate its performance in classifying the handwritten digits. Using the the same Neural netowork on a face dataset and then evaluate its performance with a deep Neural Network and a Convolutional Neural Network
